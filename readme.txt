Hello,

My name is John and I'm working on learning git/github.

This is changes made to readme.txt for readme-edits branch for the second time. Just to practice! Finally, make edits in edits branch.

1. Create a branch
2. Edit on branch
3. Make and commit changes
4. Open a pull request
5. Merge pull request


This is cool!
